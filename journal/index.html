    <h1> Week 1</h1>
    <h2>Laurel Schwulst</h2>
    <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/">My Website is a Shifting House</a>
    <p>This week's reading was inspiring. I hadn't though much about any given website's core purpose or how it affects the user, but Schwulst's writing encouraged me to consider it. I realized that I want my websites to be calming and easy to use. I don't want them to add any stress to the user's life. Hopefully my future sites can be like tiny sanctuaries in the vast ocean of the internet.</p>

    <h1>Week 2</h1>
    <h2>J.R. Carpenter</h2>
    <a href="https://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html">A Handmade Web</a>
    <p>
        I thought it was interesting how Carpenter's explanation of handmade web pages made them sound both fleeting and permanent.

    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <h2>Taeyoon Choi</h2>
    <a href="https://handmade-web.net/assets/choi_hello-world.pdf">Hello World!</a>
    <p>
        I really enjoyed this week's reading because of the accompanying watercolor drawings. They complimented the writing perfectly. I also liked the way the author likened computers to paintings.

    <h1>Week 4</h1>
    <h2>Frank Chimero</h2>
    <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/the-good-room/">The Good Room</a>
    <p>
        Quotes that stood out to me:
        <br>
        "Everyone is tired. Our attention is over-extended, over-stimulated, and over-commodified, making us twitchy, unfocused, and, in a very crude sense, afraid."
        <br>
        <br>
        "...in the last decade, technology has transformed from a tool that we use to a place where we live."
